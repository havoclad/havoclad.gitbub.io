Armin, Dr. Law, and Windsor bought a cart and Bergrom bought a mule (dummy).

Northwest into the hills and forest.

* Bergram - Navigator
* Dr. Law - Scout
* Windsor - Mapping
* Armin - also traveled

Fair number of 9' tall flightless birds 150' from DL.   (7 of them come running)


We kill all but one, take a short rest and get dummy back because of course he ran.

windmill

found the four boxes, hundreds of pounds.

up stairs are living quarters and mill parts. empty.  still.

downstairs the "secret" door, the door opens when Bergrom pulls -- the door and handle dissolves.

A ladder in a hole -- descends at least 30', bends around to a staircase down to a door.

past the door 20' to an orange line on the floor.    Past the line the hallway is hazy.  

Bergrom crosses, he can see Windsor but we can't hear anything.  On the Bergrom side it is very hot.

10' wide stairs going down past a corner.  The stairs go down at least 60'.   Another door, ornate at the bottom about 130'.  Iron door with a green leaf embossed in the middle.   

We push the door open after much ado.  Beyond is a natural cavern with dim natural light.   A number of critters eagerly awaiting their lunch...

medium two legged critters with sharp teeth and toe claws that resemble a sickle (velociraptors).

stairs turn into a slide.... 

when windsor stands he sees a huge four legged creature in the distance.   

The velociraptors attack and drop Armin before his first turn, the others fight on...

after all of them but one are down and the last one runs away.  We close the door and go upstairs for a short rest.  Back downstairs there is another door to the left.

---

bushes in a straight line.  Sturdy door with a star motif.

Dr. Law casts detect magic.  The door is not magical.

pushy door again.

20' hallway (dead end) and a porthole (with round door and ring) going down.

10' down into an octoganal room, with muck and mud on the floor.  Four glowing portals - black, red, green, and blue.  These are completely opaque unlike the orange one above.

"Power, Wealth, Death, which will you choose?  Do you even know the difference?"

Strong magic on all the portals - no other sources of magic (conjuration).

Ceiling is flat and there is some writing on the ceiling but it is unintelligible.

The portals are all energetic as we get close.  No additional writing or icons.  The black portal feels like it is sucking on us as if a draft is pushing behind us.

Bergrom hunks a copper coin into the black portal and disappears ..  the other three portals go off.

behind us is a solid black portal.  There is some draft heading into a hallway.  Not as warm in here.

Goes down 20' to another, larger room.

40x80 with two open passageways on either side and a giant solid black portal on the other end. 

Giant stone circle in the middle, 5' high.  The breeze is picking up here.

Right passageway goes to a smaller room with a green portal on the other side.

Left passageway goes to a smaller room as well with a blue portal.

Top of the platform is flat, except for a wheel horizontal like a capstan.

Turning it clockwise about 1/2 turn and the blue portal goes out.   The black portal leading out is off, just a black wall.  The large black portal is crackling perhaps more.  There is a breeze coming from green and there is energy .. there are two cabinets on the back wall.

the cabinets are plain.   Opening them, we see clothing that is made out of some weird fabric.  Giant glass bowls in there.   Strange.

No cabinets in the blue room.

Windsor on the way to the blue side recognizes that we're a little out of breath.  

Back to the cabinet we grab a costume and don them.  The glass bowls fit over heads and the unitard like costumes fit neatly over our entire bodies with footies and everything.

Through the green portal.

... and Bergrom standing on a 5x10 platform and sees... 'space' and it is odd... behind him is a wall that goes at least 100' in both directions.  every 30' another green portal.  

Leaving the platform with levitate as I leave the platform the "wall" becomes the ground.

As I get to the next platform I see a ship three platforms away and two platforms down.  maybe 120' feet away.   Three archers looking back at us... We have total cover if we stand back from the edge.

planet 13 - Bergrom is not in the rope, the loops are nearby.  He tries to flap closer to the rope and misses.  

Windsor finds Bergrom and something very large with tentacles.   But the rope whooped through him.   The large creature was really medium with 10' long feelers.

the squid brushed against his ankles -- just as Windsor brings Bergrom back through the portal.

Suits air supplies are about 1/6 depleted -- and we can't find a way to replenish that.

encouraged to hustle back to town after the air is sucked out the portals reset and we head back.
