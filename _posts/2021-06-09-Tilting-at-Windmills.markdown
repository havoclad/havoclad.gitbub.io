Go hunt the Orcs

Ernesto (1st Ed Ranger) 

New Jon guides us: We make it back to the entrance to the temple.  No bodies, the tracks probably went into the Forest to the NW.  But the tracks get fuzzy real quickly.

Ernesto has a plan to follow them.  He heads off -- way too quickly to actually be tracking.   Tom asks him to slow down.

ClapYourHands slips into a sinkhole.   Ernesto chases after.  I tie a rope around a rock and Windsor takes the other down into the pit with mage hand.

CYH pulls Ernesto out of the pit.  Around a stream Ernesto says "I think I lost them" but "I'm pretty sure they went in here".  "I don't do forests".

* Max - Tracking

Humanoid Tracks - wearing boots.  100y later across the stream we see some prints in the mud.   In the distance a decrepit windmill in a clearing another 100y off.

Totally a defensive position.  A little smoke coming out the top of the windmill.

We raised no alarms as we reached a decision point about 150' from the windmill.  Distinct lack of reasonable vegetation  (and actively cleared) for 150' around the windmill.

We find two orc sentries before they see us. One is held and goes down quickly.

Orcs start coming out of the windmill, but I web the door to slow them a bit.  

One approaches Hands and triggers and aop, but moves around to be between Hands and Max and tears his own guts out -- explosion of the concentration (poison) type.

Several others go down, we're down to one explosive orc who was tied up in the web for a while but finally escaped.

smashed crates and barrels and a manhole in the floor closed.  Directly above the floor hole is a ceiling hole (also sealed).

Door in the floor is stuck, neither max nor hands is able to open it.

Hands trys just after growing smaller (was large).   On the underside of the door is an iron bar in a V shape.  It was barred but not for the critical.

Three orcs in the cellar.   They drop Hands, but Max goes and gets him and they get a ladder up.  Windsor throws darkness down there and the orcs start missing a bit more.

The orc leader goes down and we run run run.away and run away some more.
