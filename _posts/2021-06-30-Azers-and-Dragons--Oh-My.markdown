For weeks there have been persistent rumors of dragons to the west.

This is the week we want to go west.

Armin is Cartographer permanently from now on.

* Kissira - Scout
* Max - Navigate
* Armin - Cartographer

Scouted for 14 - past spiders and pitfalls

Navigated for 4+ a tiny bit

After a few hours we exit the forest, but we found the same houses we left behind...

* Navigate - 18

We exit the woods on the other side... 

heading up into hills, trackless lands... mountains in the distance.

take bearings again in the afternoon.

* Navigate 24
* Scout 10

Found nothing...   Set up camp...  Very nice camp.

Head out west up, more up than west... then down and average is mostly up.

* Navigate - 18
* Scout - 12

we come upon a curious sight...  a river of molten rock.

we see smaller humanoids wielding solid weapons.  Kinda dwarven but their hair looks like it's on fire.

Killed the azers...

short rest...

reached a crevice in the mountain, smoke coming out somewhere above.   Smells sulferous, like the fire river.

not a lot of vegetation -- a few burned down bushes.

we make our way into the tunnel, around a few turns and we hear some sounds from around the corner ahead.

Peek we see a fair number of firey humanoids -- like slimey fire.    We attack and a dragon (medium) comes up behind us and breathes on the rear.

The dragon flys around the other side.  I magic missile it.   It flys away and we kill the humanoids, loot and look around for where the dragon ran off too.

We search the azer/bitches and find 20gp 75sp 315cp retreat from the dungeon and search for dummy and the cart.

(= 20/7 =) gp (= 75/7 =) sp (= 315/7 =) cp
