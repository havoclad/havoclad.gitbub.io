Downtime - upgraded the potion house w/Jay.  I caroused and found 5 additional party members (some temporary).

Going southwest of time

* scout (kayla)
* cartographer (jay)
* lookout (trey)
* guide (tom)
* tailgunner (bob - tom's follower)



farmhouses 5 miles from town.

Pigs, larger than normal and smelly.  Took the farmer's head off last week.

Vanquish them from the forest - extra downtime activity.

we find some orc archers and a great axe wielding leader.

* 21 sp (= 21/6.5 =)
* 17 cp (= 17/6.5 =)
* 26 gp (= 26/6.5 =)
* greataxe
* spears
* longbow
* arrows


Retreat to farmhouses to rest.

trekking through, we go far too far west, out of the forest.  Feathers goes up in the air to scout again.  We find our way back, and find the pig tracks.

two big fart pigs, two small fart pigs, and a bunch of other pigs.

the fart clouds incapacitate us, but we managed to web and hack, which gets us another quest -- celebration back in town.

collect orc ears and pig trophy, including meat for the feast.

* 476 xp
* 238 xp for Wroroe
