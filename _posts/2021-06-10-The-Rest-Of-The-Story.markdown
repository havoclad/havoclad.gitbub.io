As you were leaving the windmill, barely alive, but happy after slaying the Orc warlord a window opened.  Fearing the worst, you turned and readied.

“Hey!  Nice job, we never liked him,” says the hobgoblin.  “Do you want this barely alive bird guy he captured and had us watching?”

As you watch, warily, the three remaining hobgoblins come out with Feathers and then depart carrying little more than their bows and their friend, who you killed earlier.

With a cautious sigh of relief, and keeping a watchful eye on the departing bowmen you decide to take at least a short rest in the windmill.  It seems unoccupied and has proven to be somewhat defensible after all.

Over the next few hours you find the below as loot.  Furthermore, you find several things that might warrant further investigation when you are more fully rested.

1. In the basement, a circle of ebony stones roughly 8 feet across is inlaid into the floor
1. In the basement,  probable secret door.  (Probable because it is unopened)
1. A journal written in Orc. 

Loot:
- Royal Oil of Ice
- Greater Potion of Respite
- A great axe of superior quality - sell for 2x base price
- Chain mail, 6 other greataxes which are monster sellable.
- 2000 cp, 1400 sp, 70 gp, 2 x Blue quartz (10 gp), 3 x Malachite (10 gp), Moss agate (10 gp), Rhodochrosite (10 gp), Spell Scroll (Wall of Force)


Carry back and sell whatever you can.  The below was not carryable.  You’ll need a cart.

Several large boxes which Max and ClapYo believe to contain a large bolt thrower.  It might be quite valuable if only you could get it back to town.
