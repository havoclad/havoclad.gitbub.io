Northwest and over "that hill over there"... (Trey rolled an 8 survival)

We find the entrance to the TOMB. Stone plinth was a giveaway.   Sir Feathers searches for traps, then Max searches down the stairs.

First room there are two archways leading to solid looking walls at the back of the room.

Feathers notices no mortar between the wall in the archway and the walls.  Plus some scrapemarks along the sides.  Red at the top of the keystone.

Max drives in a piton, stands his mace in the archway, and he crouches down and pulls on the piton -- it does not go in that direction...   He tries to lift up and it starts moving.

The piton was sheared off and the mace is ok but wedged in there.   We can now see beyond it.

6 undead with skin (zombies).  Web.    Drop one and the chicken runs into Bergrom's space and gets stuck so I drop the web just before Max's turn.

Zombies have no loot, the door beyond is not trapped.

next room has zombies with bony feet.

and the bad smell we smelled earlier -- it's here.

3 smelly zombies and 6 skellys
