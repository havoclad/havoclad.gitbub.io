Fire beetle glands.

Cut out the glowy section and toss the rest.

Forest in the SW.

Find it easily -- 

Last farmers haven't seen too many beetles.

Beetles probably closer to the middle of the forest.   6 miles across, so ~3 to the middle.

Easy to find because they glow in the dark.

Enter the forest - 30' to 50' dense undergrowth.

40' away we see an elf-like creature (drow).  Shifty.  Steps out of the bushes/trees.

Melavin - what are we doing in here.

Fire Beetles, what do we want with us.

1/4 mile "over yonder" at the turn of the little stream, a nest of them underground.  There may be 12.

we find the stream, find the bend downstream a bit.  There is a high bank on one side.

Found an entrance, and the cleric discovered a trap that the artificer disabled.

Cleric found a human dude in leather armor with a crossbow leveled at the entrance.
