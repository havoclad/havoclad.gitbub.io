Downtime

Armin - Concoctions + Dirty Trick<br/>
Bergrom - Hard Work<br/>
Feathers - <br/>
Windsor  - <br/>

Back to the temple.   The second arch stymies Bergrom, banging on his legs as he fails to dodge out of the way.

We cut down a branch (after Bergrom walks around the tree to find no trees).

Blocking the next time the arch comes down, we're able to skinny under it to a door.  The door is damp, perhaps swollen shut.

* Longsword x2
* Longbow x2
* Studded Leather Armor x2

Sarcophagi are definitely not on gold or platinum pedestals.

Large Canvas paintings that have been ripped to shreds.

Two ghoulish things that try to life drain.  The pit captures the chicken temporarily.

Under a sarcophagus we find a stairs going down to a door.  The door is stuck but while trying to open it we find a wraith coming out of the door to smack at us.  It paralyzes the chicken and Bergram and disappears into the wall.

We open the door and he's "right there" but is immune to my necrotic bullshit.   I make him run away and bergram gets a hit with his crowbar.

In the room is a body of a dwarf skeleton laying under a large rock.  A corresponding hole in the ceiling looks like a place where that may have come from.  

The wraith paralyzes Wroroe and then comes for Armin.   Armin casts Dragon's Breath and breathes electricity on the wraith, just before getting hit in the face and going down.

Next round a 20 on the death save brings me back up, but the wraith has moved away.

The party chases the wraith out of the temple.  Investigating the ceiling the one block is the only one that would fall.

* Studded Leather of Useful Items (Armor, studded leather): Among the rivets covering this studded leather armor are several unique rivets inscribed with symbols. While wearing the armor, you can use an action to detach one of these rivets, causing it to become the object it represents. The armor has the following rivets: chain (10 feet), dagger, grappling hook, 2 x mace, 2 x manacles, pewter tankard, steel mirror. Once the last inscribed rivet is removed, the armor becomes nonmagical studded leather armor.

Moving the stone and collecting the bones, there is a circular pattern on the stone under the bones.   The pattern is more finely made than the stone on the walls with an inlaid mosaic.

Outside the temple is a group of 8 orcs who want us to drop our loot.   They drop Wroroe and Feathers, the rest of us run.  Wroroe didn't survive (0/2 death saves when we left).
